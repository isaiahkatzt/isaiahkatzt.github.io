<p style="font-size: 0.85em;"> I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/">Department of Statistics and Applied Probability</a> at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). I am advised by Prof. Gareth W. Peters and affiliated with the <a href="https://www.qrslab.com/">Quantitative Risk Solutions Lab (QRSLab)</a>. My research interests are primarily in time series methodology, multivariate analysis, and statistical signal processing. Much of my work focuses on applications in econometrics and computational finance settings. </p>

<p style="font-size: 0.85em;">Prior to starting my PhD at UCSB, I worked as a junior trader for <a href="https://whtrading.com/">WH Trading</a>, where I developed strategies and managed risk for a variety of futures market making books. I did my undergraduate 
degree in mathematics at Northwestern University where I worked in the <a href="https://www.driscollphysicslab.org/index.html">Driscoll Lab</a>. </p>
